Background 

On 3 June 2025, Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) won the 2025 Indian Premier League (IPL) final, 
defeating the Punjab Kings by 6 runs and securing their first ever IPL title.[1] RCB planned to hold a 
victory parade in Bengaluru on the next day.[2] The RCB team was slated to meet government officials 
including the chief minister at Vidhana Soudha and proceed to the M. Chinnaswamy Stadium, the 
team's home ground, for the celebrations.[3] 
Incident 
A large number of fans started gathering around the Chinnaswamy Stadium since 2 pm IST on 4 June 
2025.[4] At 3 pm, the influx of large number of people stalled traffic around the stadium. From 3.30 
pm, fans tried to gain entry into the stadium through one of the 13 gates situated across the 
adjoining streets. The announcement of free passes for fans resulted in ticket less fans trying to enter 
the stadium along with the ticket holders.[3][4] The resulting commotion led to a crush when people 
pushed over barricades and climbed over fences and walls.[3][5] Police attempted to control the crowd 
using lathi charge.[5][6] 
Aftermath 
Emergency services arrived at the scene, and the injured were transported to the nearby 
hospitals.[3] Eleven people were killed with six deaths reported from the state-run Bowring & Lady 
Curzon Hospitals and five deaths from two other private hospitals in the city. More than 50 injuries 
were reported and the injured were treated across multiple hospitals.[4][7] While the planned open-
bus parade was cancelled, the celebrations went ahead within the stadium premises.[8] 
Investigation 
The Government of Karnataka ordered an investigation into the accident.[5] As per the police, 
permission was not given for the event and the crush occurred at the stadium as fans tried to enter 
an already filled stadium.[4] The police also stated that more than 200,000 people were present 
around the stadium and nearly 50,000 people tried to enter the stadium, which had a capacity of 
35,000. The gates were closed by 3.30 pm to control the crowd, which resulted in the crush 
outside.[3][5] The RCB management gave confusing updated on social media about the parade and 
issuance of free passes which exacerbated the crowds.[5] 
On 5 June, a First information report for alleged criminal negligence was filed against the RCB 
management, Karnataka State Cricket Association (KSCA), the owner of the stadium, and DNA 
Entertainment, who was in charge of organizing the event. The Karnataka High Court sought a status 
report from the state government regarding the incident.[9] The state government also suspended 


The Freedom Flotilla Coalition shares video of the Madleen before communication lost. The Freedom Flotilla Coalition, who are operating the Gaza-bound aid vessel, has posted a video from the Madleen in the moment before communication was lost. It shows a chaotic scene, as activists wearing life jackets, gather as lights flash around them. One person calls for everyone to “ditch their phones” and throw them overboard. From outside, a loudspeaker can be heard.
The activists then sit and raise their hands, in what appears to be a preparation to be boarded.
One of the members, speaking on a phone, says “we are being boarded, right now … everyone here is safe. No one is wounded right now … Please raise the alarm.”
